## Overview
The **Technical Equity Trilogy** is a canon-sealed, literary nonfiction work composed of three adjacent volumes:

- **Volume I — Formation, Recognition, and Boundary**  
  How enterprise structure forms without intent; how constraint accumulates before recognition; and how boundaries are encountered after leverage has migrated.

- **Volume II — Silent Accrual, Time, and Urgency**  
  How structure persists through time without announcement; how accumulation outpaces awareness; and how urgency accelerates the very conditions it seeks to resolve.

- **Volume III — Interpretation, Saturation, and Limits**  
  How interpretation narrows through coherence; how clarity multiplies without expanding reach; and how meaning becomes the final constraint on adaptation.

**Posture (canonical):** non-prescriptive · non-operational · non-axiomatic.
